# COVID19_Predictor
A web-app that uses M.L to predict the probability of COVID-19 in a person. 

Requirements and Installation
-> Install Python

-> Open Powershell (Windows)/ Terminal (MacOS/ Linux) and then type:

For Windows
pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt/
For MacOS/ Linux
pip3 install -r path/to/requirements.txt/
Usage
-> Navigate to the repository's directory using Powershell/ Terminal and then type:

For Windows
python model.py
python app.py
For MacOS/ Linux
python3 model.py
python3 app.py
The above commands will run a flask server at localhost and the web-app will become functional.
NOTE
Keep all the directories and files together ( and also do not rename any files/directories ). Failure of this may lead to errors.
The dataset used to train the model is imaginary and hence the model gives inaccurate results. Using real world dataset will definitely fetch good outcomes.
The code of model training is also provided in a python notebook.
